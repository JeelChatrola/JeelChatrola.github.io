I am a MS in Robotics Student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering). My research interests include formal control for robotics and vision based control.

Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the [Formal Control and Autonomous Systems Lab (FOCAS Lab)](https://www.focaslab.com/) at [Center for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), supervised by [Prof. Pushpak Jagtap](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pushpak-jagtap/). 

I graduated from [Pandit Deendayal Energy University](https://www.pdpu.ac.in/) in 2022, where I majored in Electrical Engineering.
